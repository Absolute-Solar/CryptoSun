A decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) on Solana integrating solar energy, heating, and blockchain utility.

Overview
CryptoSun (CSN) is a utility token developed by Absolute Solar & Crypto Inc., built on the Solana blockchain to tokenize solar energy for heating, bitcoin mining, and peer-to-peer economic empowerment. Leveraging Solana’s high-throughput capabilities (65,000 TPS), CSN powers a sustainable ecosystem with staking rewards, quarterly dividends, and governance rights. The project aims to redefine renewable energy infrastructure through blockchain, delivering real-world utility and financial incentives.

    Token: CSN
    Initial Supply: 100,000,000 CSN
    Circulating at Launch: 19,600,000 CSN
    Initial Market Cap: $20,000 ($0.001/CSN)
    Utility: Staking, energy trading, governance

Features

    Solar Energy Integration: Converts excess solar power into CSN via ASIC mining, with heat repurposed for furnaces.
    Economic Model: Hybrid— inflationary (Years 1-2) to deflationary (Year 3+), with burns reducing supply to 92.9M CSN by Year 6.
    Staking Rewards: 42M CSN allocated, 20% quarterly dividends for top stakers from Absolute Solar & Crypto Inc.
    Smart Contracts: Rust-based, audited by CyberScope and CertiK, managing token operations, staking, governance, and more.
    Security: Ed25519 cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, continuous audits, and bug bounties.
    Roadmap: IoT integration (Q4 2025), DeFi expansion (Q4 2026), global scaling (2030: 100 MW, $100M valuation).

Technical Details

    Blockchain: Solana
    Throughput: ~65,000 TPS (peak 700,000 TPS)
    Cryptography: Ed25519 (128-bit security, 50-60 μs signing)
    Consensus: Proof of History (PoH) + Proof of Stake (PoS) + Tower BFT
    Programming: Rust, compiled to BPF bytecode
    Serialization: Borsh (150-200 byte tx size)
    Fees: Base 0.000005 SOL/signature, prioritization adjustable

Smart Contracts

    Token: Defines CSN (100M supply, 9 decimals, 1M CSN/year minting).
    Staking: Locks 42M CSN, rewards via Reward = 0.0001 · Stake · (EnergyFactor + UptimeFactor + MaintenanceFactor).
    Governance: 4M CSN, vested Months 13-24, 2/3 vote consensus.
    Burn: Reduces supply (e.g., 3.5M CSN/year by Year 6).
    Future: Energy trading (LMP pricing), maintenance (IoT-driven).

Installation
Prerequisites

    Rust: cargo --version >= 1.70
    Solana CLI: solana --version >= 1.18
    Node.js: node --version >= 16 (for tools)
    Git: git --version

Setup

    Clone the Repository:
    bash

git clone https://github.com/AbsoluteSolarCrypto/CSN.git
cd CSN

Install Dependencies:
bash

cargo build --release
npm install

Configure Solana:
bash

solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
solana-keygen new

Deploy Contracts:
bash

    solana program deploy target/deploy/csn_token.so

Usage

    Compile: cargo build --release
    Test: cargo test
    Interact: Use Solana CLI or SDK (e.g., @solana/web3.js) to call contracts.
        Example: Transfer CSN
        javascript

        const { PublicKey, Transaction } = require('@solana/web3.js');
        // Add transfer logic here
